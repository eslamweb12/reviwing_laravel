how to refactor you code
  1- instead of writting every thing in your controller you should make a serive and include it or call it when you like
  2- create a folder in the app folder and name it services
  3-create a class in it for example saveDataService
    inside this  
                 saveDataService class{

                  public function static save($data,$id=null)//why i give him id=null as i will user this function in 
                                                              //create and update 
                 //1-first method you can use

                       if($id==null){
                         modelName::query()>create($data)  

                        }else{
                          modelName::query()->find($id)->update($data)      
               
                        }   

                //2-second method you can use in create and update in the same time in you controller
                ModelName::updateOrCreate([
                   'id'=$id
             
                   ],$data)   // this mean that you can create and update if you give the id
