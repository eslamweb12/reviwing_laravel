*if you want to make pagination you should follow this 
   1-istead of $users=User::query()->with('image')->orderBy(  'id','DESC' )-get();

   we will replace $users=User::query()->with('image')->orderBy(  'id','DESC' )->paginate(3//this is the nubmber of 
                                                                                        rows that you would like to show );
 
 2-in the blade that you will show thses data in 
   after the table that you display data in it

   {{$data->links()}}// it will make it like links 


 3-as it will show bad view we should bootstrap in the function boot  in the AppServiceProvider 


    public function boot(): void
    {

    // Use Bootstrap styling for pagination

    Paginator::useBootstrap();//we will use it

    }
