when we use soft delete ?? 
  we use soft delete when we have a table with relationship and this table if we delete any thing from it it will affect
  on the other table so 
 
  for example 
   user_table    id    user_name   email    password

   product_table   id    user_id   name    info   price 
 df
in this example the user may have a product so we put a forign key in the product table constrained to the user 
if the admin like to delete any product it will affect on the products that the user bout it so we will add soft delete 
with the product table


how will we use it?
  in the migration of product_table add =>  $table->softDeletes();
 
 in the model of product_tabe define soft delete by using it is namspaece   =>use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;
 and use its trait  =>    use SoftDeletes;


 if i delete the any product deleted_at column will be added to the table and have the time that it deleted at it


this a great prefi about soft delete
